# Bifurcation Diagram of the Logistic Map

This project simulates the **Bifurcation Diagram** for the logistic map, which illustrates how a system transitions from predictable to chaotic behavior as the control parameter (denoted as **a**) changes. The logistic map is a simple mathematical model often used to describe population growth, but it also serves as a key example of chaos in dynamical systems.

## Key Features:
- **Logistic Map Dynamics**: Visualizes the transition of a system from stable equilibrium to periodic oscillations and finally to chaos as **a** increases.
- **Parameter Tinkering**: Experimented with varying **a** values to observe how different ranges lead to stable and chaotic regions.
- **Chaotic Region Identification**: Highlights where the system behavior becomes unpredictable.

## Usage:
Run the notebook to generate the bifurcation diagram and explore how the system behaves under different values of the control parameter **a**.
