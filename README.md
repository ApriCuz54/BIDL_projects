# Brain Inspired Deep Learning Projects

This folder contains projects that were part of the **Brain Inspired Deep Learning** course. These projects explore mathematical models and concepts inspired by both neuroscience and chaos theory, focusing on how complex systems behave over time.

## Included Projects:
1. **Leaky Integrate and Fire Model**:
   - A simplified model of a biological neuron.
   - Explores the response of the neuron model to various parameters and input stimuli.

2. **Bifurcation Diagram of the Logistic Map**:
   - Visualizes how a system transitions from stability to chaos.
   - Demonstrates the impact of varying parameters on the behavior of dynamical systems.
