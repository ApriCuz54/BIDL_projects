# Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) Model

This project implements the **Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF)** model, a fundamental model in computational neuroscience used to simulate the spiking behavior of neurons. The LIF model describes how neurons accumulate input over time and fire when a threshold potential is reached, with natural decay over time.

## Key Features:
- **Membrane Potential Dynamics**: Simulates changes in membrane potential in response to input currents.
- **Spike Generation**: Produces spikes when the potential crosses a defined threshold.
- **Leakage**: Accounts for the natural loss of charge in the neuron's membrane.

## Modifications:
I have tinkered with parameters like **threshold potential**, **spike potential**, and **membrane resistance** to explore how these changes affect the neuron's spiking behavior.

## Usage:
Run the notebook to simulate the LIF model and explore how parameter adjustments influence the dynamics of neuronal spiking.
